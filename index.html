                It stands on the River Thames in south-east England at the head of a 50-mile (80 km) estuary down to the North Sea and 
                has been a major settlement for nearly two millennia.The City of London, its ancient core and financial centre, 
                was founded by the Romans as Londinium and retains its medieval boundaries.

               The City of Westminster, to the west of the City of London, has for centuries hosted the national government and parliament. 
                In the 19th century, London grew rapidly, becoming the world's largest city at the time, as it expanded and absorbed 
                the neighbouring county of Middlesex, and parts of Surrey and Kent. In 1965 it was combined with parts of 
                Essex and Hertfordshire to create the administrative area of Greater London, which is governed by 33 
                local authorities and the Greater London Authority.
